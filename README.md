- task3_report.docx â€“ Report explaining the project
- output_screenshot.png â€“ Screenshot showing model training and accuracy
- dataset/ â€“ (Optional) Folder containing a sample dataset if included

## ðŸ§ª Tools and Libraries Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Google Colab (or VS Code)
- NumPy, Matplotlib

## ðŸ“Š Model Summary

- CNN layers: Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, Dense
- Activation: ReLU, Softmax
- Accuracy: Achieved accuracy of approximately *XX%* on the test dataset

## ðŸ“Œ Conclusion

The CNN model successfully classified input images and demonstrated strong performance on the selected dataset.
